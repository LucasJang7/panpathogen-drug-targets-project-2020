# panpathogen-drug-targets-project-2020

This project was conducted during summer of 2020 and unfortunately I did not have the hindsight in highschool to save the code on my old laptop so this is all that is left of the project. 

This project came from intrigue over various covid-19 solutions. The Krogan Lab specifically was looking to find drugs that could be used to treat covid by looking at shared pathways, trying to find similarities between the mechanisms of covid-19 and other viruses that already had drugs. Stemming from that idea, we wanted to pursue something more broad as I was still quite new to research so we decided to look for potential drug targets that would work in multiple pathogens. 

Throughout this project, we look at lab data generated by APMS to find shared processes between a variety of similar pathogens using R and Cytoscape. Eventually, we singled out a few processes whose proteins were highly expressed in multiple pathogens and then created networks showing the specifically relevant and shared proteins.
